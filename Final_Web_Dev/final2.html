						<h2><u>Dark Mode:</u></h2> 
						
					<p>Dark mode is a design in which the interface is dark, but with brighter typography and elements.
						It creates an easier experience for legibility as well as it's easier on the eyes, as opposed
						to a bright white screen.  However, it can be hard to read at times if not implemented properly.
						It can also make the app or site seem smaller, and more claustrophobic.  It is still not completely
						mainstream and some apps and sites still do not support it.
					</p>
					
					
						<h2><u>Minimalism:</u></h2> 
						
					<p>Considering a lot of devices are smaller these days, including mobile phones and smart watches.  Web design 
						also needs to think smaller.  Minimalism creates simple ways to navigate apps, more specifically
						apps used for smaller devices.  Quick and easy are the ideas behind the minimalist trend.  Other
						practices include using visuals instead of words to convey a message quicker.  Another perk to 
						this functionality would be simply web sites will load faster as well due to lesser elements overall.
					</p>
					
					
						<h2><u>3D Elements:</u></h2>  
						
					<p>	3D elements can add a superior visual appeal to any web site.  Integrating still and or animated 3D objects can
						entice visitors to your web site and give depth to products a user is viewing.  It also has the ability to significantly
						slow down your site though, so do not overuse this practice.  
					</p>
					
					
						<h2><u>AI Voice Interaction:</u></h2>  
						
					<p>	Voice user interface is among one of the most popular and mainstream designs among new devices.  
						It vastly improves user experience in a multitude of ways.  Usually in the form of assistance to
						the user.  It makes assistance fast and reliable, while also leaving less room for user error.  Be it customer
						service, shopping, or user inquiries, ai voice user interaction is the future of website navigation.   
					</p>
					
					
						<h2><u>Hand Drawn Elements:</u></h2>  
						
					<p>	Hand drawn elements within web pages has become extremely popular lately.  They are aesthetically pleasing,
						original, and more "personal".  It allows a web page to stand out more, and be more authentic, which can
						help it stand out more.  It can be a bad choice however, if the art is poorly drawn or is not
						properly directed at your target audience. 
					</p>
					
					
						<h2><u>Liquid Animation:</u></h2>  
						
					<p>	Liquid animation is animation with a fluidity property to it.  It can be activated in several ways be it 
						by scrolling, navigation, or even as a background.  It is a newer implemented design technique because of
						higher processing power among device technology.  This style can add a feeling of realism to sites, or just a 
						pleasing user experience.  
					</p>
