# Web_Dev_Final_2020

This is my first web development class final from fall 2020.  It contains use of HTML and CSS, utilizing various techniques such as, proper html layout, head tags, body tags, and main tags.  There is also usage of div tags utilizing idâ€™s and classes that coincide with the CSS stylesheet.  There are href links to navigate 4 different pages, as well as a link to my student email.  Proper use of table tags and form tags are implemented as well, to show understanding and competency with such practices.
